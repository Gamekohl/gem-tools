## Frequently Used Commands

### actors_to_waypoint

Directs actors to a waypoint. If outgoing waypoint links exist, actors continue along the connected path.

**Parameters:**

- **selector**: the actor(s) that should start moving (see *Selector*)
- **waypoint (.uid / .name)**: the destination waypoint (by ID or name)
- **inactive_at_startup**: if enabled, the actor is not present on the map until the command runs
- **clone**: if enabled, the original actor does not move; a clone is spawned and moves instead
  (the clone has its own **mid**; if the original has a **tag**, the clone inherits that tag)
- **force_approach**: forces a direct approach to the waypoint

### actor_state

Changes an actor’s state and behavior.

**Parameters:**

- **selector**: the actor(s) to modify (see *Selector*)
- **control**: who controls the actor
    - `user` (player)
    - `AI` (computer)
- **speed**: `slow`, `normal`, `fast`
- **speed_kmh**: speed in km/h (cannot exceed the actor’s max; `0` uses default speed)
- **movement** (humans only):
    - `normal` (standing)
    - `crawl` (prone movement)
    - `squat` (crouched movement)
- **return_fire**: `on` / `off`
- **hold_position**: `on` / `off`
- **hide_mode**: `on` (weapon ready) / `off` (weapon hidden)
- **weapon_prepare**: `on` / `off`
- **waypoint_only**:
    - `on` (follow waypoints without combat reactions / without using cover)
    - `off` (normal behavior)

### event

Changes an event state after an optional delay.

**Parameters:**

- **event**: event name
- **mode**:
    - `reset`
    - `set`
    - `toggle`
- **delay**: delay in seconds before applying the mode

### delete

Deletes selected entities (useful for cleanup when units leave the playable area).

**Parameters:**

- **selector**: actors/entities to delete (see *Selector*)

### trigger

Sets or clears a trigger.

**Parameters:**

- **name**: trigger name (selected from existing triggers)
- **on**: whether to set (`✓`) or clear (`–`) the trigger
  (when set, commands inside that trigger execute immediately)

## Actors Commands

### actors_watch

Rotates an actor toward a waypoint or scans within a radius.

**Parameters:**

- **selector**: actor that rotates (see *Selector*)
- **.uid**: waypoint ID to watch toward
- **.name**: waypoint name to watch toward
- **radius**: if > 0, the actor rotates to watch within the specified distance

**Note:** It usually makes sense to specify either a **radius** or a **waypoint**.

### wait_crew

### group_to_waypoint
